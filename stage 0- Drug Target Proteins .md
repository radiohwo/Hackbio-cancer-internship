**PROTEINS AS DRUG TARGETS**

Proteins are large molecules of about twenty amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds to form long chains. In addition to providing structural support, proteins are hormones, enzymes, building blocks, biochemical catalysts, and agents of cellular death. The primary function of proteins is to supply the building blocks for the body. They are the building blocks of several compounds of biological significance. Proteins play an essential part in human biology and health \[1].

More than 95% of the pharmacological targets that are now known are proteins, and around 93% of known drug-target interactions are facilitated by these proteins, according to recent studies \[2]. A crucial phase in the development of new drugs is the prediction of drug-target interactions \[3, 4]. Therefore, understanding novel drug-target protein interactions is essential for the development of new medications, as misinterpreted protein interactions may result in adverse drug reactions \[5, 6].

Proteins make up the great majority of a medicine's approved targets. The human proteome can be divided into two classes: approved drug targets and non-targets, based on knowledge of which proteins are the targets of authorized medications \[7, 8, 9, 10].

The fraction of proteins that are both prospective therapeutic targets—that is, associated with a disease—and capable of binding a small molecule or antibody with the necessary affinity and chemical characteristics is known as the druggable proteome \[11].

Proteins are used as drug targets for various illnesses, including cancer, and a kind of cancer treatment called targeted therapy targets the proteins that regulate the growth, division, and metastasis of cancer cells.

These proteins have been engineered to bind to particular sites on cancer cells. Certain monoclonal antibodies label cancer cells to help the immune system recognize and eliminate them more easily. Certain monoclonal antibodies either directly inhibit the growth of cancer cells or induce self-destruction in them. Others still deliver poisons to cancerous cells \[12].

For instance, blinatumomab (Blincyto®) binds to CD3, a protein on the surface of T cells, as well as CD19, a protein on the surface of leukemia cells. Through this procedure, the leukemia cells are brought close enough for the T cells to react and kill them \[13].

Proteins are valuable drug targets, as researching protein expression in cancer cells can provide details about a particular cancer type, the most effective treatment, and the efficacy of a treatment.
